# Kassie Whitney:
During the 5th iteration I was faced with many challenges including several
logic bugs involving user experience design, as well as, implementing the 
gmail API into our code base and trying to figure out how and when to call 
the api methods so that it starts the emailing process. The other thing that 
I struggled with and eventually figured out what I needed to do thanks to 
chatGPT was how to create an automated emailing timer that calls the email
methods at certain intervals.



# Salima Hafurova:
During our 5th iteration, we experienced a significant Git-related issue. 
Our original repository was named TCSS-360, but when a pull request introduced
merge conflicts, an attempt to resolve them caused the repository to be wiped.
As a result, we lost the visible commit history we had been building from the 
beginning of the quarter.

To recover, Kassie created a new repository called FileWatcher. Fortunately, 
before this Git disaster occurred, Kassie had us drag a copy of our project to 
our desktops as a backup. This precaution allowed us to restart without losing 
the entire project. While we did lose some recent changes, we were able to 
re-implement the missing work within a day.

Currently, our program is complete and functional, but our Git history no 
longer reflects the full scope of development from day one. The version history
in the new repository only shows commits from the last month, rather than
the entire timeline of our project.
