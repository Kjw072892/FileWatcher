# Kassie Whitney: 
No issues with development this week.



# Salima Hafurova:
This week, I had to add a pom.xml dependency for SQLite because my database was not running properly at
first. After adding the correct dependency, the database connection worked as expected. I finished query portion of 
DataBase Manager this week and I also completed the FileEventWatcher class and wrote the connecting code in both
FileWatcherSceneController and MainSceneController. However, I am not seeing the expected behavior or reactions from 
the program, so resolving this issue will be a priority for iteration 4.
